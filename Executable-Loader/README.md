# PageFault Detective 🔍

Embark on a journey through the intricate workings of page faults and memory mapping with this C program trio, born from the challenges of a 1st-year assignment. The code unfolds like a detective story, uncovering the mysteries of segmentation faults and crafting a solution that stands the test of unexpected errors.

## The Chronicles of Error Handling 🕵️‍♂️

Navigate the labyrinth of error detection with meticulous checks and conditional maneuvers. From verifying the type of signal to mapping the elusive pages, every step is a dance between handling defaults and tracing the origins of faults.

## Mapping Ballet in Memory 🩰

Witness the elegance of memory mapping, where pages pirouette between existence and non-existence. Dive into a custom matrix of mapped and unmapped pages, allowing for a delicate interplay of signals and calculations.

## File Manipulation Mastery 📄

Delve into the art of file manipulation, from calculating offsets to crafting robust functions like `lseek`, `read`, and `mprotect`. The code weaves together signals, memory, and files in a symphony of error-free execution.

## A Symphony of Resources 🎶

This project stands as a testament to the fusion of course materials, labs, and the wisdom tucked within the pages of function manuals. Every line of code echoes the collaborative symphony conducted by the lessons learned in the early days of programming.

May this repository serve as both a memory and a guide for future coding detectives. Happy exploring! 💻🕵️‍♀️ #CProgramming #MemoryMappingMagic #CodingChronicles
